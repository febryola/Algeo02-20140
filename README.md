## What is This Project About?
we made this project in order to fill the requirements of Linear and Geometric Algebra class in ITB
informatic engineering. this project is to create a website consist an image compression page. this
compression is created by svd algorithm that has been studied in Linear and Geometric Algebra class.
compression image page consist several fitures:

* Compression image
* pixel difference
* time compression
* download fitures

## The Process
This web was made under several conditions:
* Using Node + Express for backend
* Using vanilla (html+css+js) for frontend
* Using python and library numpy+pil for svd algorithm

## About website
This web consist several fitures and accessible in https://mengtubesalgeoooo.netlify.app/ :
* home page
* compression page
* game page -> consist 6 different mini games
* about us page -> the identity of developer
* about web -> instruction of web

## How to run
To run this program, you can run this command:
before that, make sure that you've installed all packages of npm with npm i

* Windows and Linux
```
npm run serve
```
* after that access
```
localhost:8080
```
